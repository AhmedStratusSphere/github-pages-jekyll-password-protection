# github-pages-jekyll-password-protection
Automatically password protect (with encryption) certain pages on GitHub Pages/Jekyll sites using [PageCrypt](https://github.com/Greenheart/pagecrypt).

## Demo
This repository serves as an example repository for password protecting pages. See [example.html](https://evanbaldonado.github.io/github-pages-jekyll-password-protection/example.html) (password: `examplepassword`) and [example-2.html](https://evanbaldonado.github.io/github-pages-jekyll-password-protection/example-2.html) (password: `repo_by_evanbaldonado.com!`).

## Usage
1. Configure passwords for .html pages in [_protected_pages.txt](https://github.com/evanbaldonado/github-pages-jekyll-password-protection/blob/main/_protected_pages.txt).
- Add one file per line (space-delimited in the format `filename.html password`).
    - Note that GitHub converts markdown (.md) files to .html files.
    - Because this file begins with an underscore, it will not be published when your site is deployed.
2. Add a GitHub action/workflow for encrypting pages: [./github/workflows/pages.yml](https://github.com/evanbaldonado/github-pages-jekyll-password-protection/blob/main/./github/workflows/pages.yml).
3. Automatically deploy this repository with GitHub Pages using Github Actions: `Settings > Code and automation > Pages > Build and deployment > Source > Github Actions`.

## Security
- Static websites deployed with GitHub pages can't run server-side code, which means that traditional authentication approaches to access protected files aren't possible. Additionally, GitHub pages does not support .htaccess files, another easy way to password-protect pages.
- This method relies on [PageCrypt](https://github.com/Greenheart/pagecrypt) to encrypt pages using the WebCrypto API. This allows the user to view/access/download pages but only see their contents with a password.
    - Because the user can access these files, they can download them and perform a brute-force attack to attempt to unencrypt them. Your files are only as secure as the WebCrypto API, PageCrypt, _and_ your passwords.
    - PageCrypt only encrypts .html files. For other assets (ex: .css files, .js files, and images), consider inlining them if it is important that they remain private. See [PageCrypt's documentation](https://github.com/Greenheart/pagecrypt#readme).
- Note: although the password file (_protected_pages.txt) is not published along with your site, anyone with access to the repository itself can view it.
